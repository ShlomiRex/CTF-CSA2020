We caught an undercover agent in our facilities.
He was transmitting sensitive data to our enemies using some kind of crypto machine.
We were able to capture the machine but the agent destroyed the encryption configuration he used.
It's national security matter and we only trust you to solve the mystery - what was his message?
We were able to track the enemy's other machine in this address: 18.156.68.123:80.
We COUNT on you on this, don't let us down!
Good Luck!
